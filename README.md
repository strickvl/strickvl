# Hi, I'm Alex 👋

**ML Engineer at [ZenML](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml)** | Based in Delft, Netherlands

I build tools for machine learning operations and open-source infrastructure. Before tech, I spent 15+ years as a researcher and historian working in Afghanistan — a career that taught me to find patterns in complexity and communicate clearly across domains.
